Terraform is a powerful tool that helps in quickly testing the compatibility of various components, such as Istio and Consul, to determine if they can work together. When combined with the AWS EKS Blueprints, it becomes incredibly convenient.

Terraform 是神器，能帮助快速测试某个组件，比如istio与consul能不能一起工作；
再搭配上这个aws eks blueprints，简直太方便了！
